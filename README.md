# Weather-app 

A simple weather application that allows users to check real-time weather conditions by entering a city name. It fetches data from the **OpenWeather API** and displays details like **temperature, wind speed, humidity, and weather conditions**.

## Features

-  Search for weather by city name
-  Display current temperature in Celsius
-  Show wind speed and humidity
-  Weather condition descriptions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy)
-  Clean and responsive UI
-  API integration with OpenWeather

## Tech Stack

### **Frontend**
- React (Vite)
- HTML, CSS (Styled with basic styles)
- Fetch API for data retrieval

### **Backend**
- Java (Servlets)
- Tomcat Server
- OpenWeather API integration

> ** Note:** The backend is a work in progress. I initially set it up manually without Maven, which has caused some challenges in integrating it with the front end. I plan to refactor and improve the backend for better communication between client and server.

## Installation & Setup

### 1️ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/jakearator/Weather-app.git
cd Weather-app

### 2️ Backend Setup (Java Servlet + Tomcat)

⚠ Prerequisites:
- Java JDK (17 or later)
- Apache Tomcat (10+) (I specifically used 10)
- OpenWeather API Key (Need to sign up for OpenWeather and get your **OWN** API key there

# Navigate to the Backend folder
cd Backend

# Compile the Java files
javac -cp "lib/javax.servlet-api-4.0.1.jar;." -d bin src/*.java

# Deploy the app to Tomcat:
 1️ Copy the Backend folder into Tomcat's webapps/ directory
 2️ Ensure web.xml is correctly configured inside WEB-INF/

# Start Tomcat
C:\Apache\Tomcat\apache-tomcat-10.1.39\bin\startup.bat

# Access the backend in your browser:
http://localhost:8080/weatherapp/WeatherServlet?city=New%20York

### 3️ Frontend Setup (React) 

⚠ Prerequisites:
- Node.js (16+)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

# Navigate to the frontend folder
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev

# Open the frontend in your browser:
http://localhost:5173

⚠ If the backend is not sending responses to the frontend, check the correct API URL endpoints

⚠️Furthermore, if you received a 404 error on Tomcat, ensure WEB-INF/web.xml is properly set up
