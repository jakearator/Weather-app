# Weather-app 🌦

A simple weather application that allows users to check real-time weather conditions by entering a city name. It fetches data from the **OpenWeather API** and displays details like **temperature, wind speed, humidity, and weather conditions**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌍 Search for weather by city name
- 🌡️ Display current temperature in Celsius
- 💨 Show wind speed and humidity
- ☀️ Weather condition descriptions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy)
- 🎨 Clean and responsive UI
- 🔗 API integration with OpenWeather

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### **Frontend**
- React (Vite)
- HTML, CSS (Styled with basic styles)
- Fetch API for data retrieval

### **Backend (Work in Progress)**
- Java (Servlets)
- Tomcat Server
- OpenWeather API integration

> **⚠️ Note:** The backend is a work in progress. I initially set it up manually without Maven, which has caused some challenges in integrating it with the front end. I plan to refactor and improve the backend for better communication between client and server.
