Tech Stack

- Backend: Java (Servlets)

Current status
--------------
The backend is still a work in progress. The primary challenge is integrating the manually managed dependencies with the frontend, as the project was not initially set up using Maven. Future updates will focus on resolving this issue for seamless backend-to-frontend communication.
