# Weather-app
A simple weather application that allows users to check real-time weather conditions by entering a city name. It fetches data from the OpenWeather API and displays details like temperature, wind speed, humidity, and weather conditions.

Backend: Java (Servlets) -- Work in process. I'm having trouble with the backend sending information to the frontend because I manually downloaded everything instead of using Maven from the start.
